## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Evolution of SIEM Systems

Security Information and Event Management systems have evolved significantly since their inception in the early 2000s. Early SIEM solutions were primarily log management systems with basic correlation capabilities [1]. Modern SIEM systems incorporate advanced analytics, machine learning, and real-time processing capabilities [2].

### 2.2 Microservices Architecture in Security Systems

The adoption of microservices architecture in security systems has gained momentum due to its scalability and maintainability benefits [3]. Research by Chen et al. (2020) demonstrates that microservices-based security systems can achieve 40% better performance compared to monolithic architectures [4].

### 2.3 Threat Detection Algorithms

Contemporary threat detection approaches leverage various techniques:
- **Rule-based detection** for known attack patterns [5]
- **Statistical analysis** for anomaly detection [6]
- **Machine learning algorithms** for behavioral analysis [7]
- **Correlation engines** for multi-stage attack detection [8]

### 2.4 Real-time Stream Processing

Real-time processing frameworks like Apache Kafka, Apache Storm, and custom solutions have been extensively studied for security applications [9]. The choice of processing framework significantly impacts system latency and throughput [10].

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Overall Architecture

The BITS-SIEM system follows a microservices architecture pattern with the following core principles:

- **Service Independence:** Each component operates independently
- **Horizontal Scalability:** Services can be scaled based on demand
- **Technology Diversity:** Different services can use optimal technologies
- **Fault Isolation:** Failure in one service doesn't affect others

```python
class BruteForceDetector:
    def __init__(self, threshold=5, window_seconds=300):
        self.threshold = threshold
        self.window_seconds = window_seconds
        self.attempts = defaultdict(list)
    
    def analyze_event(self, event):
        if event.event_type != 'authentication_failure':
            return None
            
        key = f"{event.source_ip}:{event.username}"
        current_time = event.timestamp
        
        # Clean old attempts outside window
        self.attempts[key] = [
            t for t in self.attempts[key] 
            if (current_time - t).total_seconds() <= self.window_seconds
        ]
        
        # Add current attempt
        self.attempts[key].append(current_time)
        
        # Check if threshold exceeded
        if len(self.attempts[key]) >= self.threshold:
            return self.create_threat_alert(event, len(self.attempts[key]))
        
        return None
```

#### 4.2.2 Alert Correlation Engine

The correlation engine implements temporal and spatial correlation to reduce false positives:

```python
class AlertCorrelationEngine:
    def correlate_alerts(self, new_alert, existing_alerts):
        correlations = []
        
        for existing in existing_alerts:
            score = self.calculate_correlation_score(new_alert, existing)
            if score > self.correlation_threshold:
                correlations.append({
                    'alert_id': existing.id,
                    'correlation_score': score,
                    'correlation_type': self.determine_correlation_type(new_alert, existing)
                })
        
        return correlations
    
    def calculate_correlation_score(self, alert1, alert2):
        # Implement scoring based on:
        # - Time proximity
        # - Source IP similarity
        # - Attack type correlation
        # - Affected systems overlap
        pass
```

### 4.3 Database Schema
